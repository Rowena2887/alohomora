                        What I liked this week were the assignments.
                        I haven't touched HTML/CSS for a few years so I'm a bit rusty.
                        I also liked how you taught us to deploy a website on GitHub.
                        I've always thought that deploying a website means purchasing a domain.
                        GitHub has many more tools than I have previously thought.

                    <td colspan = "4">
                        I wish the class was a bit more organized with a bit more structure.
                        I also think the Workshops are great for Q&A but if no one has questions,
                        maybe it would be best to use the time to do algorithm challenges or have students showcase their work.

                        I think the material is great so far. 
                        This area doesn't need any improvement.
