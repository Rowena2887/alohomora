        <h1>Formal Languages and Functional Programming (CISS 301)</h1>
        <p>Introduction to discrete structures important to computer science, including sets, trees, functions, and relations. Proof techniques. Introduction to the formal language classes and their machines, including regular languages and finite automata, context free languages and pushdown automata. Turing machines and computability will be introduced. Programming using a functional language is required in the implementation of concepts.</br></p>
        <h1>Secure Software Development (CISS 346)</h1>
        <p>Techniques, methodologies and processes for development of robust, secure software. Security development process, threat modeling, common software vulnerabilities, web site vulnerabilities, defensive coding practices, security testing.</br></p>
        <h1>Computer Security (CISS 461)</h1>
        <p>An overview of computer security and detailed study of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of some aspects of security, including policy specification, the role of cryptography, policy implementation and assurance, security threats and counter-measures.</br></p>
        <h1>Advanced Network System Security (CISS 469)</h1>
        <p>Discussion of current topics security aspects of industrial control, SCADA systems, cloud computing, mobile devices.</br></p>
        <h1>Policy, Compliance, & Risk (CISS 470)</h1>
        <p>This course examines the policy, legal, regulatory, framework, and standards documents that provide requirements and guidance for cybersecurity, and the resulting compliance and audit requirements. The course covers risk-based techniques for assessing compliance and integrating compliance initiatives into cybersecurity strategy, planning, and projects.</br></p>
        <h1>Cyber Privacy, Ethics & Abuse (CISS 471)</h1>
        <p>This course investigates issues that arise in Privacy and Ethics in an Internet connected world, and how those issues intersect with cybersecurity. The course examines how privacy and ethical issues have been, or are currently being, addressed. In addition, the course covers topics in cybercrime, cyber-stalking, and other abusive behaviors in cyberspace.</br></p>
        <h1>Cryptographic Techniques (CISS 478)</h1>
        <p>A study of the cryptographic techniques and tools commonly used in support of security for computer systems and networks.</br></p>
        <h1>Cybersecurity Capstone Project (CISS 491/492/493)</h1>
        <p>Cyber Range Intrusion Detection System - By nature, cyber ranges are attractive targets for hackers. This makes it important for the cyber range to maintain active monitoring for potential abuse. For this projects, students will design and build an Intrusion Detection System built for the specific needs of the cyber range.</br></p>
