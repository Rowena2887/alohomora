        <h1>Computers Systems I (CISS 247)</h1>
        <p>
            An overview of basic computer organization and design. Introduction to C programming. Topics covered include data representation, boolean algebra, machine language, instruction sets, processor architecture, multi-processors, system-level I/O, pipelining, and the memory hierarchy.</br>
            <i>Textbook: C Programming Language, Author: Kernighan</i></br>
            </br>
            <u>Update (November 2021): This class was extremely challenging and rigorous, and I did not feel like I had fully grasp C, so I decided to redo my assignments to fix the bugs and learn from my past mistakes.</u></br>

            <i>Assignment 1 - Encryption/Decryption</i></br>
            In this C program, the objective is to decrypt an encrypted file using an 8-character encryption key to recover the original plain text message. Both the encryption and decryption algorithms uses the same 8-character encryption key. To obtain the keys, a key is given where the first 4 characters are manipulated from 4 bytes to septets along with the last 4 characters resulting in key1 and key2.</br>
            </br>
            <u>Update (January 2022): This is a decryption assignment. The goal was to reverse the steps used by the encryption method. Given a sequence of seven hexadecimal digits, convert them into an integer. Then Exclusive OR it with Key 2. Shuffle the nibbles and then Exclusive OR it with Key 1. Finally, group the 28 bits into four 7-bit septets and rotate each septet left by 3 bits. Then translate the septets into characters.</u></br>

            <i>Assignment 2 - Spelling Correction</i></br>
            In this assignment, the C program suggests spelling corrections to English words entered from the keyboard. Words entered by the user of the program will be compared to a list of over 105,000 words supplied in a data file. If an entered word is not found in the word list, the program will suggest spelling alternatives.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Assignment 3 - Seven Segment Displays</i></br>
            For this assignment, I developed a C program that displays integer numbers in the style of a seven segment digital display, using only spaces (“ ”), underscore (“_”), and vertical bar (“|”) characters.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Lab 1 - Text Replacement</i></br>
            For this lab, our goal is to substitute a substring from a line of text read from a standard input stream in C programming. It needs to be noted that the replacement substring and newly replaced substring are exactly the same length.</br>
            </br>
            <u>Update (December 2021): Find the given substring in a string and replace it with the new string.</u></br>
            <u>Trick: Nested for loops, Keeping a good index count of the character in the string and the character in the substring</u></br>

            <i>Lab 2 - Number Conversions</i></br>
            For this lab, our goal is to complete a C program that will add two numbers, both specified in the same number system, with base value from 2 to 36. Each number will be represented as a character string, using the characters ‘0’ through ‘9’ and ‘A’ through ‘Z’. The characters ‘0’ through ‘9’ are their usual decimal numeric values and the characters ‘A’ though ‘Z’ have the decimal values 10 through 35.</br>
            </br>
            <u>Update (December 2021): Given the two digits and base number, add them together using the same number system. They start out as strings and then transformed into integers and then back to strings after calculation. Each number will be represented as a character string, using the characters ‘0’ through ‘9’ and ‘A’ through ‘Z’. The characters ‘0’ through ‘9’ are their usual decimal numeric values and the characters ‘A’ though ‘Z’ have the decimal values 10 through 35. Lastly, the base value ranges from 2 to 36.</u></br>
            <u>Trick: Calculating the digits correctly using the ASCII Table, Calculating the number system conversions correctly, Building arrays during string to integer conversion</u></br>

            <i>Lab 3 - Bitwise Logical Operations</i></br>
            In this lab exercise, I’ve written several function definitions to solve puzzles in bits using only a limited set of operators in the C language.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Lab 4 - ARM Emulator</i></br>
            The goal for this lab is to write a program that simulates the execution of at least 7 ARM instructions. One out of the seven must be a branch instruction. The program will have an array that represents the general ARM registers and a second array of structs that represents memory. The program will read content into the memory array from a file, execute the instructions it finds in the array one instruction at a time, and print the contents of the registers after each instruction.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Lab 5 - ARM Emulator (Part 2)</i></br>
            The objective of this lab is to expand the ARM processor simulation and include stack operations. The program will have an array that represents the general ARM registers and an array of structures that represents memory. The program will read the content into the memory array from a file, execute the instructions and print the contents of the registers including the program counter and stack after each instruction.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Lab 6 - Floating Point</i></br>
            The objective of this lab is to implement floating-point operations, operating directly on bit-level representations of floating-point numbers. For implementation purposes, there are a limited set of operators in the C language that can be used.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Lab 7 - Bomb Lab</i></br>
            The nefarious Dr. Evil has planted a slew of “binary bombs” on our class machines. A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequence of phases. Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin.  If you type the correct string, then the phase is defused and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase has been defused. There are too many bombs for us to deal with, so we are giving each student a bomb to defuse. Your mission, which you have no choice but to accept, is to defuse your bomb before the due date. Good luck, and welcome to the bomb squad!</br>

            Reverse engineer an executable program by using the disassemble capability of the gdb debug utility.</br>
