        <h1>Database Concepts (CISS 340)</h1>
        <p>
            This course covers the design, implementation, and use of databases. The objective is to learn, analyze, and model data and data usage to create an efficient and normalize database using a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as SQL. Additionally, security implications of different databases and database access techniques are also included in the curriculum.</br>
            </br>
            <i>SQL 1 - Basics</i></br>
            1. List first names and last names of employees whose first name is Elvis.</br>
            2. Display the number of employees whose first name is Elvis.</br>
            3. Display the first name and last name of employees sorted based on their age (listing the youngest employees first).</br>
            4. Display the first and last name of the employee that has a first name 'Elvis' and is the oldest employee.</br>
            5. Display the first name, last name and rounded years worked of all employees sorted in a desceding order based on the rounded years.</br>
            6. Display the age of the oldest employee (as an int) in absolute years (assuming they are still working there).</br>
            7. Display the sex and counts of employees for each sex.</br>
            </br>
            <i>SQL 2 - Advanced Querying</i></br>
            1. Display the first name, last name, latest salary of the 10 higher salaried employees still actively working in the company.</br>
            2. Display the first name and last name as well as department name of all department managers. SORT by department name, last name, first name.</br>
            3. Which employee got the largest salary increase since they started working in the company? (display emp_no, salary increase in percentage rounded in 2 decimal places, e.g., 100%).</br>
            4. How many women and how many men are working on each department. Display dept name, gender and number of people working.</br>
            5. Using the previous query, create a view (this will help you from copy pasting it) and display the ratio of women to men for each department (women # divide it by the men # in the same department). Display department and ratio rounded in 2 decimals points.</br>
            </br>
            <i>MySQL + Java Copy</i></br>
            Allow the manager to access some of the database but without having to teach them SQL. Build a command line interface (CLI) for the HR manager and pretend that they would be using such an interface to manage the employee database.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Database Design: ER Diagram</i></br>
            A security company keeps track of their employees using an Excel file. Disaster! They finally want to migrate to an ACID compliant database system. To create the database, develop an entity-relationship diagram. Indicate all entities, relationships, and fields. For fields identify the data types. Create a data dictionary which defines the data used in the database.</br>
            </br>
            <i>Database Vulnerabilities</i></br>
            Figure out how to perform a sql injection for the cat.php script and print the hashed password. Write an exploit of the vulnerability found using Python.</br>
