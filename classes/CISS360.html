            </br>
            <i>Process Script</i></br>
            Write a BASH script that helps to manage processes and/or threads.</br>

            </br>
            <i>Service Monitor</i></br>
            Create a powershell cmdlet which looks at the services which are running. The cmdlet must check the running services against a list of known allowed services and indicate any which are not on the list. If the service is not listed, then the cmdlet should provide information about the service and its status. The cmdlet should also determine if the service is on the autostart list. If the allowed services list determines that the service should be set to autostart, then it will do so. The cmdlet should give the option of adding the service to the allowed services list. The name of the services list should be settable as an attribute. The cmdlet must have a help function.</br>
