            <i style="font-style: normal;">Certification: Microsoft Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals</i><br/>
            <i style="font-style: normal;">Study Duration: 4 months (+3 weeks holiday vacation)</i><br/>
            This was my first Microsoft certification and I thought it should have been easier than expected (according to Reddit forums). A few of the questions asked about Azure costs and that seemed irrelevant to me in my opinion. Overall, not bad for a few weeks/months (professional) Azure experience. My flashcard count for this was at 181. These are the resources that I used to help me pass my Exam AZ-900 on my first try:<br/>

            <i style="font-style: normal;">Certification: CompTIA Security+ SY0-601</i><br/>
            <i style="font-style: normal;">Study Duration: 3 months</i><br/>
            This was my first cybersecurity certification. It was definitely more challenging than I have expected but it was very doable. Practice, practice, practice!!! These are the resources that I used to help me pass my Sec+ on my first try:<br/>
            <li><a href = "https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/exam-objectives">CompTIA Exam Objectives</a> - This was the key to my success. As long as you study all of the objectives, you should be fine. Don't forget those pesky acronyms! I made flashcards for those, all 350 of them.</li>
            <li><a href = "https://www.comptia.org/training/books/security-sy0-601-study-guide">eBook The Official CompTIA Security+ Study Guide (SY0-601)</a> - I read this book front to back and then reread it again a couple more times to fill in my knowledge gaps. Very useful!</li>
            <li><a href = "https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/">Professor Messerâ€™s SY0-601 CompTIA Security+ Course</a> - I used this for passive learning. The videos were great as a supplemental resource but don't rely heavily on them. Also, watch his Study Group Replays. They contained little nuggest of information on what the exam is structured like and what you need to be focused on.</li>
            <li><a href = "https://gcgapremium.com/security-sy0-601-online-study-packages/">Darril Gibson's Practice Test Questions</a> - This was worth the cost. Out of all the practice test questions that are available on the internet, I thought his practice questions were the closest to the real thing. These are the type of curveball questions you will see on the exam.</li>
            <li><a href = "https://www.examcompass.com/comptia/security-plus-certification/free-security-plus-practice-tests">ExamCompass CompTIA Security+ Certification Practice Test Questions</a> - These were quick little practice questions to test your knowledge.</li>
            <li><a href = "https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-labs/security">CompTIA CertMaster Labs for Security+</a> - This was not worth the price tag. It did not prepare me for the exam's performance-based questions at all.</li>
